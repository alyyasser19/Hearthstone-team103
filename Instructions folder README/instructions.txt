the game was made using the javaFx library and jdk 13 (images included)
sometimes after importing javaFx you're required to go and edit the launch configuration,
the following line in VM options:
--module-path "C:\Users\alyya\Downloads\Compressed\openjfx-11.0.2_windows-x64_bin-sdk\javafx-sdk-11.0.2\lib"  --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
instead of C:... etc
add the location of the lib folder for javaFx.

the game was made and optimized to be played in 1080p otherwise it will have some scaling problems.
finally the video for the bonus is in MKV (for compression purposes).
